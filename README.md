# micrograd

micrograd is a minimalistic neural network library designed to facilitate an understanding of the inner workings of neural networks. This library provides a simple interface for designing neural network architectures, executing a forward pass, and performing backpropagation. It includes a small set of neurons organized into a network, and utilizes a directed acyclic graph for visualizing state propagation. This visualization aids in the step-by-step, layer-by-layer understanding of loss propagation during the backward pass.

## Features

- Design and implement simple neural network architectures.
- Perform forward passes and backpropagation.
- Visualize network state and loss propagation using directed acyclic graphs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing `micrograd`, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Relevant Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib` for visualization (if necessary)
